            "question": "A study indicates that 2% of the population carries a specific gene. A new genetic test correctly identifies 90% of the carriers, but also gives a positive result for 10% of those who do not carry the gene. If a person tests positive, is it more probable that they actually have the gene or that they are a false positive?",
            "answer": "15.5",
            "explanation": "The majority of positive test results are false positives because the low base rate of carrying the gene outweighs the test's accuracy."

A test for this disorder is accurate 95% of the time for those who have it, and 98% accurate for those who do not. If a person tests negative, what are their odds of actually not having the disorder, and why is it not simply 98%?",
            "answer": "99.97",
            "explanation": "Posterior probability considers both true negatives and the rarity of the disorder, making the result higher than the specificity alone."

If a randomly selected person tests positive, what is the probability they actually have the disease?",
